# Git / GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers and teams to track, manage, and collaborate on code efficiently, while GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that enables hosting repositories, reviewing code, managing projects, and automating workflows. In the DevOps lifecycle, Git and GitHub together play a critical role by enabling version control, collaboration, and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making it easier to develop, test, deploy, and monitor applications in a streamlined and automated manner.

Here‚Äôs a clear and concise definition of **Git** and **GitHub** specifically for **DevOps** context:

---

### üîß Git (For DevOps)

**Git** is a **distributed version control system** used to track changes in source code during software development.  
In DevOps, Git plays a crucial role in **collaboration, automation, and continuous integration** by:

- Managing code versions across teams
- Supporting branching and merging for feature development
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines
- Storing Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts

‚úÖ Git ensures **traceability**, **rollback**, and **parallel development** in DevOps workflows.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è GitHub (For DevOps)

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git that provides tools for **code hosting, collaboration, and automation**.  
In DevOps, GitHub is widely used for:

- Hosting Git repositories
- Code review and pull requests
- Automating CI/CD with **GitHub Actions**
- Managing issues, projects, and documentation
- Integrating with DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, etc.

‚úÖ GitHub enhances DevOps practices by enabling **automation**, **collaboration**, and **continuous delivery** directly from the repository.
