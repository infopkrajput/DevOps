# ðŸ§  2. Memcached Setup (on `mc01`)

### âœ… Step 1: SSH into the Memcached VM

```bash
vagrant ssh mc01  # Connect to the 'mc01' virtual machine via SSH
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Switch to the root user

```bash
sudo -i  # Switch to root user for full administrative access
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Verify `/etc/hosts` entry

> Ensure the hostnames and IP addresses for all VMs are listed in the hosts file.

```bash
cat /etc/hosts  # View current host-to-IP mappings
```

> If entries are missing, manually add them using a text editor like `vi` or `nano`.

---

### âœ… Step 4: Update the system

> Keep the OS packages up to date with the latest patches and updates.

```bash
dnf update -y  # Update all packages to the latest version
```

---

### âœ… Step 5: Install Memcached

> EPEL repository is needed to install some extra packages including Memcached.

```bash
dnf install epel-release -y  # Enable EPEL repository
dnf install memcached -y     # Install Memcached server
```

---

### âœ… Step 6: Start & enable Memcached service

```bash
systemctl start memcached    # Start the Memcached service
systemctl enable memcached   # Enable Memcached to start on system boot
systemctl status memcached   # Verify Memcached is running
```

---

### âœ… Step 7: Configure Memcached to accept external connections

> By default, Memcached listens only on `127.0.0.1`. Weâ€™ll update it to listen on `0.0.0.0` so that it can accept connections from other VMs.

```bash
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g' /etc/sysconfig/memcached  # Replace localhost with 0.0.0.0 for external access
```

> Restart the service to apply changes.

```bash
systemctl restart memcached  # Apply the new configuration
```

---

### âœ… Step 8: Configure the firewall

> Allow access to Memcached ports (TCP 11211 for regular use, and optionally UDP 11111).

```bash
systemctl start firewalld         # Start the firewall service
systemctl enable firewalld        # Enable firewall on boot

firewall-cmd --add-port=11211/tcp  # Open Memcached default TCP port
firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent  # Make the rule persistent

firewall-cmd --add-port=11111/udp  # (Optional) Allow UDP port for Memcached
firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent  # Make this rule persistent too
```

---

### âœ… Step 9: Run Memcached in background with custom ports

> Use the following command to launch Memcached in daemon mode using the specified ports.

```bash
memcached -p 11211 -U 11111 -u memcached -d  # Run Memcached as a background daemon on specified ports
```
