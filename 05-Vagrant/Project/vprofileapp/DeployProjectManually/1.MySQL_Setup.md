# ðŸ’¿ 1. MySQL Setup (on `db01`)

### âœ… Step 1: SSH into the DB VM

```bash
vagrant ssh db01  # Connect to the 'db01' virtual machine via SSH
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Switch to the root user

```bash
sudo -i  # Elevate privileges to root user
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Update the system

> This ensures your OS packages are up to date.

```bash
dnf update -y  # Update all installed packages to the latest version without asking for confirmation
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Install required packages

> EPEL provides extra packages for Enterprise Linux. MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL.

```bash
dnf install epel-release -y  # Add the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository
dnf install git mariadb-server -y  # Install Git and MariaDB (MySQL-compatible) server
```

---

### âœ… Step 5: Start & enable MariaDB service

```bash
systemctl start mariadb  # Start the MariaDB database service
systemctl enable mariadb  # Enable MariaDB to start automatically on system boot
```

---

### âœ… Step 6: Secure MariaDB installation

> This script improves MariaDB security by removing test users, setting a root password, disabling remote root login (optional), and more.

```bash
mysql_secure_installation  # Launches a script to secure your MariaDB installation
```

> Use `admin123` as the root password and follow this input sequence when prompted:

```
Set root password? [Y/n] Y
New password: admin123
Re-enter new password: admin123
Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] y
Change the root password? [Y/n] n
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y
```

---

### âœ… Step 7: Create the database and user

> Log into MariaDB using the root user and create a new database along with a user that has full access to it.

```bash
mysql -u root -padmin123  # Log in to MariaDB using the root user and previously set password
```

Now execute the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE accounts;  -- Creates a new database named 'accounts'

-- Grants full access to the 'accounts' database to user 'admin' when connected from localhost
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';

-- Grants full access to 'admin' from any host (useful for remote connections)
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;  -- Reloads the privilege tables so that changes take effect
EXIT;  -- Exit from the MariaDB shell
```

---

### âœ… Step 8: Clone the project and initialize the DB schema

> We will now fetch the source code and load a backup SQL dump into the `accounts` database.

```bash
cd /tmp/  # Change directory to /tmp
git clone -b local https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project.git  # Clone the project code from GitHub using the 'local' branch
cd vprofile-project  # Navigate into the project folder

# Import the database backup into the 'accounts' database
mysql -u root -padmin123 accounts < src/main/resources/db_backup.sql
```

> Confirm that tables have been imported correctly:

```bash
mysql -u root -padmin123 accounts  # Log in again to check tables
show tables;  # List all tables in the 'accounts' database
exit;  # Exit MySQL
```

---

### âœ… Step 9: Configure the firewall

> Open the MySQL port (3306) in the firewall so that other services can connect to it.

```bash
systemctl start firewalld  # Start the firewall service
systemctl enable firewalld  # Enable firewall to run on boot

# Allow traffic to port 3306 (MySQL) on the public zone
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3306/tcp --permanent

firewall-cmd --reload  # Reload firewall configuration to apply changes
```

---

### âœ… Step 10: Restart MariaDB

```bash
systemctl restart mariadb  # Restart MariaDB to ensure all changes are applied
```
