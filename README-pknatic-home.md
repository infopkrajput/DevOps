# DevOps Learning 🚀  

Welcome to my **DevOps Learning** repository! This repository is my personal log of learning DevOps step by step, tracking my progress with topics covered, and useful resources.  

## 📖 Learning Pathway  
I am following a structured approach to learning DevOps, covering key concepts such as:  
- [**01-Introduction**](./01-Introduction/) 📄
- [**02-Prerequisites**](./02-Prerequisites/) ⚙️
- [**03-VM-Setup**](./03-VM-Setup/) 💻  
- [**04-Linux**](./04-Linux/) 🐧  
- [**05-Vagrant**](./05-Vagrant/) ✌️
- [**06-Docker**](./06-Docker/) 🐳 

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each topic has its own directory containing relevant notes, practice exercises, and projects.
