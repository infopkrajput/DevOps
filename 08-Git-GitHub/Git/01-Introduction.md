# Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel.

Key characteristics of Git:
- **Distributed**: Every developer has the full history of their code repository locally
- **Fast**: Most operations are performed locally
- **Secure**: Uses SHA-1 hashes to ensure data integrity
- **Flexible**: Supports various non-linear development workflows

## Why Learn Git?

1. **Industry Standard**: Used by over 90% of development teams
2. **Collaboration**: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project
3. **Version Control**: Track changes and revert to previous states
4. **Branching**: Work on features independently without affecting main code
5. **Open Source Contribution**: Essential for contributing to open source projects

## Prerequisites

Before starting with Git:
- Basic familiarity with command line (Terminal/Command Prompt)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git installed on your system ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

To verify Git is installed:
```bash
git --version
```

This should display the installed Git version (e.g., `git version 2.37.1`).
