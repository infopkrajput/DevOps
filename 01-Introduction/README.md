# 01-Introduction  

## What is DevOps?  
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automation, and efficiency in the software development lifecycle. It helps organizations develop applications and services **faster**, **more reliably**, and **with better quality**, enabling them to serve customers effectively and stay competitive. DevOps also focuses on **automating repetitive tasks**, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring smooth software deployment and maintenance.

# Software Development Lifecycle  
When a company develops software for a client, the process follows a structured lifecycle that ensures the software meets requirements, is well-tested, and is maintained properly. The key phases of the **Software Development and Maintenance Lifecycle** are:  

1. **Requirement Gathering** ‚Äì Understanding client needs and project scope.  
2. **Planning** ‚Äì Defining the development roadmap, resources, and timeline.  
3. **Designing** ‚Äì Creating software architecture, UI/UX design, and system workflow.  
4. **Development** ‚Äì Writing and implementing the actual code for the application.  
5. **Testing** ‚Äì Ensuring software quality by identifying and fixing bugs.  
6. **Deployment & Maintenance** ‚Äì Releasing the software for production and continuously monitoring, updating, and improving it.  

In traditional software development, these phases were handled separately, leading to delays and inefficiencies. **DevOps bridges this gap** by integrating development and operations teams, automating workflows, and enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

## The entire process form requirement gathering to deploy and maintain is called SDLC.
We have different Models in SDLC
- Waterfall model
- AGILE
- SPIRAL
- BIG BANG
- Etc.

Here‚Äôs a simple explanation of all SDLC models with examples:

## **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models**  
The entire process from **requirement gathering** to **deployment and maintenance** is called the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. Different SDLC models are used based on project requirements, timelines, and team structures.  

---

### **1. Waterfall Model** (Step-by-Step Approach)  
**Definition:**  
The Waterfall model is a **linear and sequential** approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. There is **no going back** to previous stages.  

**Phases:**  
1. Requirement Gathering  
2. Design  
3. Development  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  
6. Maintenance  

**Example:**  
A **banking application** follows the Waterfall model because security requirements are strict, and each phase must be carefully planned before development starts.  

**Pros:** ‚úÖ Simple to manage, well-documented.  
**Cons:** ‚ùå No flexibility for changes once a phase is completed.  

---

### **2. Agile Model** (Fast & Flexible Development)  
**Definition:**  
Agile follows an **iterative approach**, where work is divided into **small cycles called sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks). Continuous feedback is taken from customers, and improvements are made in every iteration.  

**Example:**  
A **food delivery app** (like Zomato, Swiggy) uses Agile to frequently update features, fix bugs, and introduce new functionalities based on customer feedback.  

**Pros:** ‚úÖ Flexible, customer-focused, delivers working software quickly.  
**Cons:** ‚ùå Requires close team coordination, needs continuous involvement from clients.  

---

### **3. Spiral Model** (Risk-Driven Development)  
**Definition:**  
The Spiral model is used for **complex projects** where risk analysis is important. It combines **Waterfall and Agile** by repeating development in **spirals (loops)** while evaluating risks at each phase.  

**Phases in Each Spiral:**  
1. Planning  
2. Risk Analysis  
3. Development & Testing  
4. Review & Next Spiral  

**Example:**  
A **defense software system** (used in military applications) follows the Spiral model because security risks must be evaluated before every update.  

**Pros:** ‚úÖ Good for high-risk projects, early risk detection.  
**Cons:** ‚ùå Expensive, requires skilled risk analysis.  

---

### **4. Big Bang Model** (No Planning, Just Development)  
**Definition:**  
In the Big Bang model, **there is no planning**. Developers start coding based on a rough idea and adjust requirements as they go. This model is used for **small projects** with uncertain or evolving requirements.  

**Example:**  
A **small startup creating a mobile game** may use the Big Bang model to experiment with features and adjust based on user reactions.  

**Pros:** ‚úÖ Fast development, suitable for small projects.  
**Cons:** ‚ùå High chance of failure, not suitable for large projects.  

---

### **Other Models**  
- **Incremental Model** ‚Äì Development happens in small parts, each building on the previous one (e.g., adding features to WhatsApp in updates).  
- **V-Model (Validation & Verification)** ‚Äì Similar to Waterfall but with a strict focus on testing at every stage (e.g., medical software development).
