# Introduction  

## What is DevOps?  
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automation, and efficiency in the software development lifecycle. It helps organizations develop applications and services **faster**, **more reliably**, and **with better quality**, enabling them to serve customers effectively and stay competitive. DevOps also focuses on **automating repetitive tasks**, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring smooth software deployment and maintenance.

# Software Development Lifecycle  
When a company develops software for a client, the process follows a structured lifecycle that ensures the software meets requirements, is well-tested, and is maintained properly. The key phases of the **Software Development and Maintenance Lifecycle** are:  

1. **Requirement Gathering** – Understanding client needs and project scope.  
2. **Planning** – Defining the development roadmap, resources, and timeline.  
3. **Designing** – Creating software architecture, UI/UX design, and system workflow.  
4. **Development** – Writing and implementing the actual code for the application.  
5. **Testing** – Ensuring software quality by identifying and fixing bugs.  
6. **Deployment & Maintenance** – Releasing the software for production and continuously monitoring, updating, and improving it.  

In traditional software development, these phases were handled separately, leading to delays and inefficiencies. **DevOps bridges this gap** by integrating development and operations teams, automating workflows, and enabling continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
